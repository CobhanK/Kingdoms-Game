ABOUT THIS GAME
--------------------------------
The goal of this game is to battle and defeat the enemy kingdom. This is accomplished by managing resources so one can conscript armies. 
Armies when they enter within 1 square of an enemy army or 3 squares of an enemy fort, they enter into a battle with them. 
Building can be accomplished by pressing 4 while the game is running. It will check if there are sufficient resources to build something.
Navigate game menus by reading and selecting menu options by entering numbers into the console.
